flask-class
===========

This is the repo for a Flask class I teach fairly often for DC PyLadies.

Topics covered in this class:

* HTML
* CSS (Including Bootstrap)
* Flask
* Virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
* Deployment
* Best practices

Topics not covered:

* Python
* Javascript and jQuery
* Fabric and server set-up

Sections
========

This class will be run in three sections. The first is dedicated to set-up and
installation. The second will cover HTML and CSS. The third covers development
with Flask.

These classes can occur on the same day, if you don't mind a long day, or you're
dealing with students who are already proficient with developing for the web.
If you have a class that is new to any of the topics, however, you may want to 
teach the classes on their own days.

Section 1
---------

* Install:
   * virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
   * pip and easy install
   * Flask (just to check)
   * SQLite
* Goals:
   * Make sure all students can run the stack
   * Explain what will be covered in the next two classes
* Note: This is not a 'class' *per se*, but can be used to optimize the time
  alloted for the actual classes. Full attention can be given to problematic
  systems, and students will be able to tinker around on their own time.
